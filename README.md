# SpNPpnps
Some Bioinformatic tools during my days in Prof Zhou's lab

This tool was designed to estimate dn/ds (pn/ps) from alignments generated by EToKi align-phylo modules, and annotate the SNP sites.
BTW, it was also for Willa, in some words.

Module 1: ConSequence
  It generate a file containing the Node, Contig and locus name in reference genome, mutation sites and types and specified consequence that mutation leads to.
